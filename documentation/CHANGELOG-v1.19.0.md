# Color Me Same v1.19.0 - Major Update

## Overview
This release introduces significant gameplay improvements including progressive difficulty, undo functionality, and temporarily disables special tiles for a cleaner experience.

## Major Changes

### 1. Progressive Grid Sizes
- **Easy Mode**: Always 3x3 grid (unchanged)
- **Medium Mode**: 
  - Starts at 6x6 (changed from 4x4)
  - Progresses to 8x8 at level 6
  - Progresses to 10x10 at level 11
  - Progresses to 12x12 at level 16
  - Progresses to 14x14 at level 21
  - Progresses to 16x16 at level 26
  - Progresses to 18x18 at level 31
  - Maxes out at 20x20 at level 36
- **Hard Mode**:
  - Starts at 10x10 (changed from 5x5)
  - Progresses to 12x12 at level 4
  - Progresses to 14x14 at level 7
  - Progresses to 16x16 at level 10
  - Progresses to 18x18 at level 13
  - Maxes out at 20x20 at level 16

### 2. Undo Functionality
- **Easy Mode**: Unlimited undos
- **Medium Mode**: 5 undos per puzzle
- **Hard Mode**: 1 undo per puzzle
- Visual indicators show remaining undos
- Undo history is cleared on new game or reset

### 3. Reset Button Improvements
- Now properly resets to the initial scrambled state (not solved state)
- Maintains the original locked tile configuration
- Clears all progress and undo history
- Available in all difficulty modes

### 4. Special Tiles Temporarily Disabled
Power tiles and locked tiles have been stashed (commented out) but the logic is preserved for future use:
- **Power Tiles**: Would affect 3x3 area instead of + pattern
- **Locked Tiles**: Would require multiple clicks to unlock
- All configuration values set to 0 to disable generation
- Code is well-documented for easy re-enabling

## Technical Implementation

### Grid Size Calculation
```typescript
function getProgressiveSize(baseSize: number, difficulty: string, level: number): number {
  if (difficulty === 'easy') return 3;
  
  if (difficulty === 'medium') {
    const progression = Math.floor((level - 1) / 5);
    return Math.min(16, 6 + progression * 2);
  }
  
  if (difficulty === 'hard') {
    const progression = Math.floor((level - 1) / 3);
    return Math.min(16, 10 + progression * 2);
  }
  
  return baseSize;
}
```

### Undo System Architecture
- Game state includes:
  - `undoHistory`: Array of previous game states
  - `undoCount`: Number of undos used
  - `maxUndos`: Maximum allowed (-1 for unlimited)
- Each move saves current state before applying changes
- Undo restores grid, locked tiles, moves, and player move history

### State Management Updates
- Added `initialGrid` and `initialLocked` to store reset state
- Added `UNDO` and `RESET` actions to game reducer
- Updated `NEW_GAME` action to set undo limits based on difficulty

## UI Changes
- Removed Wildcard and Freeze power-ups (not implemented)
- Changed from 4-column to 3-column layout for power-ups
- Added Undo button with count indicator
- Updated Reset button to show unlimited symbol for easy mode
- Improved tooltips for clarity

## Bug Fixes
- Fixed TypeScript errors in solvability.ts (unused parameters)
- Fixed reset functionality to properly restore initial state
- Ensured undo history is properly managed across game states

## Migration Notes
- Existing saved games will continue to work
- Power tiles and locked tiles in existing games will be ignored
- Undo functionality is automatically available based on difficulty

## Future Considerations
- Power tiles and locked tiles can be re-enabled by uncommenting code
- Grid size progression can be adjusted by modifying the progression formulas
- Undo limits can be changed in the `getMaxUndos` function
