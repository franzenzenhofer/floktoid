# Boss Bird Mechanics

## Overview
Boss Birds are special enemy units that appear every 5 waves in FLOKTOID to provide challenging gameplay moments. They are larger, tougher, and more dangerous than regular birds.

## Current Status
âœ… **ACTIVE**: Boss Birds are now **FULLY IMPLEMENTED** and spawn every 5 waves with progressive difficulty!

## Boss Bird Characteristics

### Visual Design
- **Size**: 2.5x larger than regular birds
- **Shape**: Menacing triangular form with inner glow effect
- **Color**: 
  - Purple (#9900FF) for non-shooting bosses
  - Red (#FF0066) for shooting bosses
- **Shield**: Double-layered hexagonal energy shield that pulses and changes color based on health percentage

### Combat Stats
- **Health**: Variable (5, 10, or 15 HP based on wave pattern)
- **Speed**: 60% of regular bird speed (slower but more deliberate)
- **Force**: 180% of regular bird force (stronger steering capabilities)
- **Points**: 400 points when destroyed (10x regular bird), 50 points per hit

### Shield System
The boss bird features a dynamic hexagonal shield visualization:
- **>66% Health**: Cyan shield (#00FFFF)
- **33-66% Health**: Yellow shield (#FFFF00)  
- **<33% Health**: Red shield (#FF0000)
- **Effect**: Double-layer hexagon with pulsing animation
- **Alignment**: Rotated to match bird direction (pointed up)

### Behavior
- Follows the same flocking algorithm as regular birds
- Can steal energy dots like regular birds
- More resilient to player attacks
- Flash effect when damaged (50% transparency for 100ms)

## Boss Spawn Pattern

### Wave Pattern
Boss waves occur every 5 waves (5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, etc.)

### Progressive Difficulty System

#### Cycle 1 (Waves 5, 10, 15) - Introduction
- **Wave 5**: 1 boss, 5 HP, no shooting
- **Wave 10**: 1 boss, 10 HP, no shooting
- **Wave 15**: 1 boss, 15 HP, no shooting

#### Cycle 2 (Waves 20, 25, 30) - Shooting Introduced
- **Wave 20**: 1 boss, 5 HP, 50% shooting
- **Wave 25**: 1 boss, 10 HP, 50% shooting
- **Wave 30**: 1 boss, 15 HP, 50% shooting

#### Cycle 3 (Waves 35, 40, 45) - Multiple Bosses
- **Wave 35**: 2 bosses, 5 HP each, 60% shooting
- **Wave 40**: 2 bosses, 10 HP each, 60% shooting
- **Wave 45**: 2 bosses, 15 HP each, 60% shooting

#### Cycle 4 (Waves 50, 55, 60) - Three Bosses
- **Wave 50**: 3 bosses, 5 HP each, 70% shooting
- **Wave 55**: 3 bosses, 10 HP each, 70% shooting
- **Wave 60**: 3 bosses, 15 HP each, 70% shooting

And so on, with boss count capped at 5 maximum.

## Code Structure

### Files
- `/src/engine/entities/BossBird.ts` - Complete boss bird implementation
- `/src/engine/CentralConfig.ts` - Configuration for boss wave interval
- `/src/engine/ScoringSystem.ts` - Scoring events for boss interactions

### Key Methods
```typescript
class BossBird extends Boid {
  takeDamage(): boolean  // Returns true if destroyed
  updateShield(): void    // Updates shield visual
  destroy(): void         // Cleanup on death
}
```

## Scoring Integration

### Active Scoring Events
- `BOSS_HIT` - 50 points when boss takes damage
- `BOSS_DEFEATED` - 400 points when boss is eliminated (10x regular bird)
- Combo multipliers apply to boss points

## Implementation Details

### Boss Spawning Algorithm
```typescript
getBossConfig(): { count: number, health: number, shootingPercent: number } {
  if (wave % 5 !== 0) return { count: 0, health: 0, shootingPercent: 0 };
  
  const bossWaveNumber = Math.floor(wave / 5);
  const cycleNumber = Math.floor((bossWaveNumber - 1) / 3);
  const positionInCycle = ((bossWaveNumber - 1) % 3);
  
  const health = (positionInCycle + 1) * 5; // 5, 10, or 15
  const count = Math.min(cycleNumber + 1, 5); // 1, 2, 3... capped at 5
  const shootingPercent = cycleNumber > 0 ? Math.min(50 + (cycleNumber - 1) * 10, 100) : 0;
  
  return { count, health, shootingPercent };
}
```

## Future Enhancements

### Possible Additions
1. **Boss Abilities**
   - Speed burst when health drops
   - Spawn minion birds
   - Temporary invulnerability
   
2. **Boss Variants**
   - Different boss types every 10 waves
   - Unique attack patterns
   - Special energy dot stealing abilities

3. **Boss Rewards**
   - Bonus points for quick elimination
   - Power-ups on defeat
   - Temporary player buffs

## Technical Notes

### Memory Management
- Proper cleanup of shield graphics
- Timeout clearing to prevent memory leaks
- Resource destruction on boss death

### Performance
- Boss birds add minimal overhead
- Shield animation is GPU-accelerated
- No significant impact on frame rate

## Activation Instructions

To enable boss birds, modify `/src/engine/NeonFlockEngine.ts`:

1. Import BossBird class
2. Add spawn logic in `startWave()` method
3. Check for wave % BOSS_WAVE_INTERVAL === 0
4. Create and add boss to boids array

## Balance Considerations

- Boss health (3) provides challenge without frustration
- Slower speed allows strategic planning
- Shield visualization gives clear health feedback
- Wave 5 interval prevents overwhelming difficulty curve
