# Color Me Same - Project Summary

## 🎮 What We've Built

A progressive puzzle game built with React 18, TypeScript, and deployed on Cloudflare Workers. Features a comprehensive level progression system from beginner to master with 70+ levels.

### Core Components

1. **React Frontend** (`src/`)
   - React 18 with TypeScript for type safety
   - Tailwind CSS for responsive design
   - Framer Motion for smooth animations
   - Context API + useReducer for state management

2. **Game Engine** (`src/utils/`)
   - Reverse-move puzzle generation (100% solvable)
   - Pure functional grid operations
   - BFS-based hint system
   - Mathematical solvability verification

3. **Level Progression System**
   - Levels 1-10: Easy (3x3 grids, unlimited undos)
   - Levels 11-20: Medium (6x6 grids, 5 undos, time limits)
   - Levels 21+: Hard (10x10-20x20 grids, 1 undo, strict time)
   - Belt progression: White → Black belt

4. **Responsive Design**
   - Dynamic tile sizing for any screen
   - Mobile-first approach
   - Supports grids from 3x3 to 20x20

5. **Deployment & Build**
   - Vite for fast development and optimized builds
   - Cloudflare Workers for edge deployment
   - Automated version bumping
   - CI/CD ready
