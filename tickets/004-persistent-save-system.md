# Ticket #004: Create Persistent Save System

## Priority: High
## Status: Open
## Created: 2025-01-25
## Depends On: #003
## Blocks: #001, #006

## Overview
Implement a save system that persists player progress between sessions using localStorage or Cloudflare KV.

## Current State (IS)
- No save system
- Progress lost on page refresh
- No persistent state

## Desired State (SHOULD)
```typescript
interface SavedGameState {
  currentLevel: number;
  totalPoints: number;
  levelPoints: number;
  completedLevels: number[];
  lastPlayed: string; // ISO date
  version: string; // For save compatibility
}

// Auto-save after each level completion
// Load on app start
// Handle save versioning/migration
```

## Implementation Requirements
1. **Save Triggers**
   - After completing each level
   - When closing/leaving the game
   - Periodic auto-save during gameplay

2. **Save Location**
   - Primary: localStorage for immediate access
   - Backup: Cloudflare KV for cross-device (future)

3. **Save Management**
   - Versioning for backward compatibility
   - Migration system for save format changes
   - Corruption detection and recovery

## API Design
```typescript
class SaveManager {
  save(state: SavedGameState): Promise<void>
  load(): Promise<SavedGameState | null>
  clear(): Promise<void>
  migrate(oldSave: any): SavedGameState
  isValid(save: any): boolean
}
```

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Progress saves automatically after level completion
- [ ] Progress loads on game start
- [ ] Save survives page refresh
- [ ] Corrupted saves handled gracefully
- [ ] Save format is versioned
- [ ] Can clear save data for new game
- [ ] No performance impact from saving
